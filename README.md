# I'm currently reworking this repo as there are dependencies 
# ChatGPT-Voice-Bot

Welcome to my attempt at making a Voice Recognition and Text to speech ChatGPT Bot.

To use this script you'll need [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed!
You'll need to edit the file to use it;

 - Get an OpenAI API Key from https://beta.openai.com/account/api-keys
 - Add your OpenAI API Key to the `openai.api_key = ""`
 - Set your own activation phrase by changing the `trigger_phrase =  "OK Nexus"`

This script was created as a test of using ChatGPT, although it was originally JS for a website, but none of the JS scripts are any good.
Feel free to contribute!

to run the file simply run the python file
`python NextGPT.py`
